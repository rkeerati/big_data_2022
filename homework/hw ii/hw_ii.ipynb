    "**Goal:** Last class we went through the building blocks to create investable portfolios from characteristics that forecast future returns. In this homework you are going to explore a different characteristic that has traditionally been associated with future returns: the past performance. The momemtum strategy is the one that invests in a portfolio that goes long stock with high past performance (high past returns) and short the ones with low performance (low past returns). Your goal in this homework is to calculate the cumulative returns of the momentum portolio from 1970.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Since we will cover the momentum factor in more details in our last lecture, for this assignment you will focus your efforts on portfolio sort (Part 4) and comparing your results to those from Fama and French (Part 5).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delivery:** Upload on canvas a .zip file with your code (it might include .ipynb or .py) and your answers (.html notebook). "

    "In order to calculate the momentum factor, first we need to calculate the \"past cumulative returns\". This is the only characteristic that you need to construct yourself. But the code is already here for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Carhart (1997) paper offers many windows of cumulating returns and months to be skipped before the formation date. In the code we have adopted the notation ret_{window}_{skip}, where {window} is the number of months to cumulate the returns and {skip} is the number of months to be skipped before this return is used for sorting.\n",

    "𝑟𝑒𝑡\\_11\\_1  is the 11 months cumulative returns, skipping 1 month, or, it is cumulative returns from 12 months before to one month before the formation date. This is the characteristic we are going to use to calculate the MOM factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful, the ret_{window}_{skip} notation is not to be confused with the Ken French notation. Since we are going to hold it for the following month, when Ken French report returns, he calls them: \"portfolios formed on prior (2-12) return\". Again, this for portfolio holding returns, not sorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to be mindful about missing returns. We are going to follow the convention in Daniel and Moskowitz, JFE 2016, that says: \"We require that a firm ... [has] a minimum of eight monthly returns over the past 11 months, skipping the most recent month\". That means that if there are less than eight valid returns in the 11-period, we should set ret_11_1 equal to missing."
